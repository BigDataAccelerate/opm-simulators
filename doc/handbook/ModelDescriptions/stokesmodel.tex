\-This model implements laminar \-Stokes flow of a single fluid, solving a momentum balance\-: \[ \frac{\partial \left(\varrho_g {\boldsymbol{v}}_g\right)}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \left(p_g {\bf {I}} - \mu_g \left(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{v}_g + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \boldsymbol{v}_g^T\right)\right) - \varrho_g {\bf g} = 0, \]

and the mass balance equation\-: \[ \frac{\partial \varrho_g}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\cdot}\left(\varrho_g {\boldsymbol{v}}_g\right) - q_g = 0 \]

\-This is discretized by a fully-\/coupled vertex-\/centered finite volume (box) scheme in space and by the implicit \-Euler method in time.
