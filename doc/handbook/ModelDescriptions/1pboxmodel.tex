\-Single-\/phase, isothermal flow model, which solves the mass continuity equation \[ \phi \frac{\partial \varrho}{\partial t} + \text{div} (- \varrho \frac{\textbf K}{\mu} ( \textbf{grad}\, p -\varrho {\textbf g})) = q, \] discretized using a vertex-\/centered finite volume (box) scheme as spatial and the implicit \-Euler method as time discretization. \-The model supports compressible as well as incompressible fluids.
