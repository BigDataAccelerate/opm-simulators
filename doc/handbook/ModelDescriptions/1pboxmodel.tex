\-Single-\/phase compressible isothermal flow model, \begin{align*} \phi \frac{\partial \varrho}{\partial t} + \text{div} (- \varrho \frac{\textbf K}{\mu} ( \text{grad}\, p -\varrho {\textbf g})) = q, \end{align*} discretized using a vertex-\/centered finite volume (box) scheme as spatial and the implicit \-Euler method as time discretization. \-Of course, the model can also be used for incompressible single phase flow modeling, if a fluid with constant density is chosen in the problem file.
