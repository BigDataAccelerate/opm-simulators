\section{Solving problems using the fully-implicit models}
\label{tutorial-coupled}

The process of setting up a problem using \eWoms can be roughly
divided into four parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A suitable model has to be chosen.
\item The geometry of the problem and correspondingly a grid have to
  be defined.
\item Boundary and initial conditions and material properties have to be
  selected.
\end{enumerate}

The physical set-up of the flow problem being solved in this tutorial
is illustrated in Figure \ref{tutorial-coupled:problemfigure}: It
consists of a rectangular domain with no-flow boundary conditions on
the top and on the bottom of the domain, which is initially fully
saturated by oil. Water infiltrates from the left side into the domain
and replaces the oil. The effect of gravity is neglected for this
problem.

\caption{Geometry of the tutorial problem with initial and boundary conditions.}\label{tutorial-coupled:problemfigure}
\end{figure}

The solved equations are the mass balances of water and oil:
\begin{align}
  \label{massbalancewater}
  \frac {\partial (\phi \, S_{w}\, \varrho_{w})}{\partial t}
  -
  \nabla \cdot \left( \varrho_{w} \, \frac{k_{rw}}{\mu_{w}} \, \mathbf{K}\;\nabla p_w \right)
  -
  q_w
  & =
  0 \\
  \label{massbalanceoil}
  \frac {\partial (\phi \, S_{o}\, \varrho_{o})}{\partial t}
  -
  \nabla \cdot \left( \varrho_{o} \, \frac{k_{ro}}{\mu_{o}} \, \mathbf{K}\;\nabla p_o \right)
  -
  q_o 
  & =
  0
\end{align}

\subsection{The main source file}

Listing \ref{tutorial-coupled:mainfile} shows the main application
file \texttt{tutorial/tutorial\_coupled.cc} uses the fully implicit
model that assumes immiscibility. This file has to be compiled and
executed in order to solve the problem described above.

\begin{lst}[File tutorial/tutorial\_coupled.cc]\label{tutorial-coupled:mainfile} \mbox{}
  \lstinputlisting[style=eWomsCode, numbersep=5pt, firstline=25, firstnumber=25]{../../tutorial/tutorial_coupled.cc}
\end{lst}

In \eWoms, this file is usually quite short, as most of the work for
setting up the simulation is done by the generic startup routine
\texttt{Dumux::start()}. The tasks left for the main source file are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Inclusion of the necessary header files from line
  \ref{tutorial-coupled:include-begin} to line
  \ref{tutorial-coupled:include-end}.
\item Specifying the type tag of the problem which is going to be
  simulated at line \ref{tutorial-coupled:set-type-tag}.
\item Starting the simulation using default \eWoms startup routine
  \texttt{Dumux::start()} on line \ref{tutorial-coupled:call-start}.
\end{itemize}

The default \eWoms startup routine deals with parsing the command line
arguments, reading the parameter file, properly setting up the \Dune
infrastructure, creating the grid, and starting the actual simulation.
Required parameters for the start of the simulation, such as the
initial time-step size, the simulation time or details of the grid,
can be either specified by command line arguments of the form
(\texttt{--parameter-name=value}), in the file specified by the
\texttt{--parameter-file="file\_name"} argument. A list of all
recognized parameters that can be specified at run time can be printed
by passing the \texttt{--help} argument to the exectutable of the
simulation.

\subsection{The problem file}

When solving a problem using \eWoms, the most important file is the
so-called \textit{problem file} as shown in
listing~\ref{tutorial-coupled:problemfile}.

\begin{lst}[File tutorial/tutorialproblem\_coupled.hh]\label{tutorial-coupled:problemfile} \mbox{}
\lstinputlisting[style=eWomsCode, numbersep=5pt, firstline=25, firstnumber=25]{../../tutorial/tutorialproblem_coupled.hh}
\end{lst}

This file specifies everything that is related to the physical
problem. It first sets up the properties relevant for this problem
using the \eWoms property system (for more information see chapter
\ref{sec:propertysystem})
\begin{itemize}
\item First, a new type tag is created for the problem in line
  \ref{tutorial-coupled:create-type-tag}.  In this case, the new type
  tag inherits all properties from the \texttt{BoxTwoP} type tag, which
  means that for this problem the two-phase box model is chosen as
  discretization scheme.
\item On line \ref{tutorial-coupled:set-problem}, a problem class is
  specified for the new type tag, while the grid which is going to be
  used is defined in line \ref{tutorial-coupled:set-grid} -- in this
  case that is \texttt{Dune::YaspGrid}.
\item Since there's no uniform mechanism to allocate grids in \Dune,
  \eWoms features the concept of grid creators. In this case the
  generic \texttt{CubeGridCreator} is used. This grid creator constructs a structured
  hexahedron grid of a specified size and resolution. For this grid
  creator the physical domain of the grid is specified via the
  run-time parameters \texttt{Grid.upperRightX},
  \texttt{Grid.upperRightY}, \texttt{Grid.numberOfCellsX} and
  \texttt{Grid.numberOfCellsY}. These parameters can be specified via
  the command-line or in a parameter file.
\end{itemize}

Next, an appropriate fluid system -- which specifies the thermodynamic
relations of the fluid phases -- has to be chosen. By default, the
fully-implicit immiscible model uses the
\texttt{TwoPImmiscibleFluidSystem}. This fluid system simplifies
things considerably by assuming immiscibility of the phases, but it
requires to explicitly specify the fluids used for the wetting and
non-wetting phases. In this case, liquid water based on the relations
from IAPWS'97~\cite{IAPWS1997} is chosen as the wetting phase on line
\ref{tutorial-coupled:wettingPhase} and liquid oil is chosen as the
non-wetting phase on line \ref{tutorial-coupled:nonwettingPhase}. The
next property, which is set in line \ref{tutorial-coupled:gravity},
tells the model not to use gravity. This is then followed by the
specifcation default values for parameters specifying the temporal and
spatial domain from line \ref{tutorial-coupled:default-params-begin}
to line \ref{tutorial-coupled:default-params-end}.  The values of thos
can be overwritten at run-time if desired.

Following the property definition is the definition actual physical
set-up to be simulated. This is done by means of the \textit{problem
  class}. The problem class specifies boundary and initial conditions,
source terms or spatial quantities like temperature, porosity,
intrinsic permeability and the parameters of the material law within
the domain. Since there are quite a few methods of the problem called
by the \eWoms models, and often there are sensible defaults for these
methods, it is strongly recomended to derive the problem class from
the class specified by the \texttt{BaseProblem} property as can be
seen on line \ref{tutorial-coupled:def-problem}\footnote{Technically,
  deriving the problem from the \texttt{BaseProblem} property is not
  required if it implements all necessary methods. Do not complain if
  things explode in this case, though.}.

For isothermal multi-phase porous media models, problem class must always provide at least
the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{initial()} for specifying the initial condition within
  the domain.
\item \texttt{source()} specifying the source term for each conservation quantity.
\item \texttt{boundary()} specifying the conditions which apply on the domain boundary.
\item \texttt{temperature()} specifying temperature at a given time
  and at a given position of the domain. If energy is conserved, this
  method is not necessary, but energy fluxes must be provided in the
  \texttt{boundary()} and \texttt{source()} methods and an initial
  temperature needs to be defined in the \texttt{initial()} method.
\item \texttt{intrinsicPermeability()} returns the intrinsic
  permeability matrix $\mathbf{K}$ in $[m^2]$ at a given location.
\item \texttt{porosity()} returns the ratio of pore space to
  total volume of the medium at a given location.
\item \texttt{materialLawParams()} returns the function parameters for
  the capillary pressure and relative permeability relations at a
  given location.
\end{itemize}

All of these methods take a single template argument,
\texttt{Context}, and the three function arguments \texttt{context},
\texttt{spaceIdx} and \texttt{timeIdx}. Together these form the
\textit{execution context}. The execution context can be thought of as
a collection of all available information when a given method is
called. Execution contexts are thus a way to abstract the differences
of the different discretization schemes. The following methods are
provided by all \text{context} objects:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{pos(spaceIdx, timeIdx)}: This method returns the
  relevant position of the execution context within the physical
  domain.
\item \texttt{globalSpaceIndex(spaceIdx, timeIdx)}: Returns a global
  index for the spatial entity which is described by the execution
  context. This index can be used to store spatially dependent
  information in an array.
\item \texttt{element()}: Returns the \Dune grid element for which the
  execution context is valid.
\item \texttt{gridView()}: Returns the \Dune grid view of which the
  element is part of.
\item \texttt{problem()}: Returns the \eWoms object which describes
  the physical problem to be solved.
\item \texttt{model()}: Returns the \eWoms model which is used to simulate
  the physical problem.
\end{itemize}

The execution contexts for the \texttt{source} and \texttt{boundary}
methods provide the following methods in addition:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{volVars(spaceIdx, timeIdx)}: The secondary variables
  used by the model relevant for the execution context. These are
  useful to specify solution dependent source and boundary terms.
\item \texttt{primaryVars(spaceIdx, timeIdx)}: The vector of primary
  variables to which the model solves for.
\end{itemize}

Finally, the execution context for the \texttt{boundary} method
provides the methods \texttt{boundarySegmentArea(spaceIdx, timeIdx)},
and \texttt{normal(spaceIdx, timeIdx)}, which return the area and
outer unit normal of the execution context's boundary segment.

When specifying the boundary conditions in the problem class, a small
safeguard value \texttt{eps\_} is usually added when comparing spatial
coordinates. For the problem considered here, the left boundary might
hence not be detected if checking whether the first coordinate of the
global position is equal to zero, but by testing whether it is smaller
than a very small value \texttt{eps\_}. Also, the \texttt{bboxMax()}
(``\textbf{max}imum coordinate of the grid's \textbf{b}ounding
\textbf{b}ox'') method is used here to determine the extend of the
physical domain. It returns a vector with the maximum values of each
global coordinate of the grid. This method and the analogous
\texttt{bboxMin()} method are provided by the problem's base class.

In addition to these methods, there might be some additional
model-specific methods. 

\subsection{Defining fluid properties}
\label{tutorial-coupled:description-fluid-class}

The \eWoms distribution includes some common substances which can be
used out of the box. The properties of pure substances (such as
the components nitrogen, water, or the pseudo-component air) are
provided by header files located in the folder
\texttt{dumux/material/components}.

When two or more components are considered, interactions between pure
substances become relevant and properties of these mixtures of
substances -- e.g. composition, density or enthalpy -- are of
interest. Such interactions are defined by {\em fluid systems}, which
are located in \texttt{dumux/material/fluidsystems}. A more thorough
overview of the \eWoms fluid framework can be found in
chapter~\ref{sec:fluidframework}.

\subsection{Exercises}
\label{tutorial-coupled:exercises}
The following exercises will give you the opportunity to learn how you
can change soil parameters, boundary conditions, run-time parameters
and fluid properties in \eWoms.

\subsubsection{Exercise 1}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\alph{enumi})} For Exercise 1 you have
to make only some small changes in the tutorial files.  

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Running the Program} \\
  To get an impression what the results should look like you can first run the original version of 
the coupled tutorial model by typing  \texttt{./tutorial\_coupled}. 
Note, that the time-step size is automatically adapted during the simulation. 
For visualizing the results using the program \texttt{paraview}, please refer to section \ref{quick-start-guide}.

\item \textbf{Changing the Model Domain} \\
  Change the size of the model domain so that you get a rectangle with
  edge lengths of $\text{x} = \unit[400]{m}$ and $\text{y} =
  \unit[500]{m}$ and with discretization lengths of $\Delta \text{x} =
  \unit[20]{m}$ and $\Delta \text{y} = \unit[20]{m}$. For this you can
  either change the properties defined between lines
  \ref{tutorial-coupled:default-params-begin} and
  \ref{tutorial-coupled:default-params-end} (don't forget to
  re-compile the program in this case), or pass you may pass them as
  command line parameters to the simulation when you run it.  Note,
  that you do not have to recompile the program if you add command
  line parameters to the executable.

  If you chose to change the problem file, re-compile the simulation
  by typing \texttt{make tutorial\_coupled}. In both cases, don't
  forget run the simulation as explained above.
  
\item \textbf{Boundary Conditions} \\
  Change the boundary conditions in the file
  \texttt{tutorialproblem\_coupled.hh} so that water enters from the
  bottom and oil is extracted from the top boundary. The right and the
  left boundary should be closed for water and oil fluxes. 

  Note that in \eWoms, flux boundary conditions are specified as
  fluxes of the conserved quantities into the direction of the outer
  normal per area. This means a mass flux into the domain is negative,
  a flux out of the domain is always positive. Re-compile the
  simulation by typing \texttt{make tutorial\_coupled} and re-run it
  as explained above.

\item \textbf{Changing  the Shape of the Discrete Elements} \\
  In order to complete this exercise you need a \Dune grid module that
  is capable of handling simplex grids. By default, \Dune does not
  include such a grid manager in its core modules, but one such grid
  manager that is freely available
  \texttt{ALUGrid}~\cite{ALUGRID-HP}. If you did not install such a
  grid manager, please skip this exercise.  

  To complete this excercise, change the problem's grid creator on
  line \ref{tutorial-coupled:set-gridcreator} to
  \texttt{SimplexGridCreator<TypeTag>} and the type of the grid to
  \texttt{Dune::ALUSimplexGrid<2, 2>} on line
  \ref{tutorial-coupled:set-grid}. You also need to change the include
  statement from \texttt{cubegridcreator.hh} to
  \texttt{simplexgridcreator.hh} on line
  \ref{tutorial-coupled:include-grid-creator}.

  The resulting grid can be examined by re-compiling and starting the
  simulation, loading the result into \texttt{paraview}, and selecting
  \texttt{Surface with Edges} as the visualization mode.

\item \textbf{Changing Fluids} \\
  In this exercise you will change the fluids used. Use DNAPL instead
  of Oil and Brine instead of Water. To do that, you may follow the
  steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Brine: Brine is thermodynamically very similar to pure water but
  also considers a fixed amount of salt in the liquid phase.  Hence,
  the class \texttt{Dumux::Brine} calls back to a class which
  represents pure water. This can be, for example \texttt{Dumux::H2O},
  or \texttt{Dumux::SimpleH2O}.  The class which represents pure water
  is passed to \texttt{Dumux::Brine} as the second template argument
  after the data type for scalar values, i.e. the full definition of
  the brine component is \texttt{Dumux::Brine<Scalar,
    Dumux::H2O<Scalar> >}. The file which defines the brine component
  is located in the folder \texttt{dumux/material/components/}.  
  Include this file and select use the brine component as the wetting phase.
\item DNAPL: Now let us include a component representing an oil that
  is heavier than water (in environmental engineering this class of
  substances is often called \textbf{d}ense
  \textbf{n}on-\textbf{a}queous \textbf{p}hase \textbf{l}iquid
  (DNAPL)) which is also located in the folder
  \texttt{dumux/material/components/}. Try to include the file and
  use the \texttt{DNAPL} component as the non-wetting phase.
\end{enumerate}
If you want to take a closer look on how the fluid classes are defined
and which substances are available in the \eWoms distribution, feel
free to browse through the files in the directory
\texttt{dumux/material/components} and to read
chapter~\ref{sec:fluidframework}.

\item \textbf{Use a Full-Fledged Fluid System} \\
  In \eWoms, the canonical way to describe fluid mixtures is via
  \textit{fluid systems}\footnote{For a thorough introduction into
    fluid systems and the concepts related to it, see chapter
    \ref{sec:fluidframework}}.  In order to include a fluid system,
  you first have to comment out lines
  \ref{tutorial-coupled:2p-system-start}
  to \ref{tutorial-coupled:2p-system-end} in the problem file.\\
  Now include the file
  \texttt{dumux/material/fluidsystems/h2oairfluidsystem.hh}, and
  instruct the model to use this fluid system by setting
  \texttt{FluidSystem} via:\\
\begin{lstlisting}[style=eWomsCode]
  SET_TYPE_PROP(TutorialProblemCoupled, 
                FluidSystem,
                Dumux::FluidSystems::H2OAir<typename GET\_PROP\_TYPE(TypeTag, Scalar)>)
\end{lstlisting}
However, this is a rather complicated fluid system which considers
mixtures of components and also uses tabulated components that need to
be initialized -- i.e. some components use tables for expensive to
calculate quantities that need to be filled with values.  The
initialization of the fluid system is normally done in the constructor
of the problem by calling \texttt{FluidSystem::init();}.

Remember that in \Cplusplus, the constructor always the same name as
the respective class, i.e. \texttt{TutorialProblemCoupled(..)}.

As water flow replacing a gas is much faster, test your simulation
only until $2000$ seconds and start with a time step of $1$ second.

Please revert the changes made in this part of the exercise, as we
will continue to use immiscible phases from here on and hence do not
need a complex fluid system.

\item \textbf{Changing Constitutive Relations} \\
  Instead of using a regularized Brooks-Corey law for the relative
  permeability and for the capillary pressure saturation relationship,
  use an linear material law which does not consider residual
  saturation. The new material law should exhibit an entry pressure of
  $p_e = 0.0\;\text{Pa}$ and maximal capillary pressure of
  $p_{c_{max}} = 2000.0\;\text{Pa}$. To do that, you have to change
  the material law property on line
  \ref{tutorial-coupled:eff2abs} as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item First, switch to the linear material law. This can be achieved
  by replacing \texttt{RegularizedBrooksCorey} in the private section
  of the property definition by \texttt{LinearMaterial} and rename
  \texttt{RawMaterialLaw} to \texttt{TwoPMaterialLaw}. Also remove the
  line which contains the \texttt{EffToAbsLaw} typedef.
\item Then adapt the necessary parameters of the linear law and the
  respective \texttt{set}-functions can be found in the file
  \texttt{dumux/material/fluidmatrixinteractions/2p/linearmaterialparams.hh}.\\
  Call the \texttt{set}-functions from the constructor of the problem.
\item Finally, re-compile and re-run the simulation. In order to
  successfully compile the simulation, you also have to include the
  header file which contains the linear material law. This header is
  called \texttt{linearmaterial.hh} and is located in the same
  directory as the header for the regularized Brooks-Corey law,
  \texttt{regularizedbrookscorey.hh}.
\end{itemize}
 
\item \textbf{Heterogeneities}  \\
  Set up a model domain with the soil properties given in Figure
  \ref{tutorial-coupled:exercise1_d}. Adjust the boundary conditions
  so that water is flowing from the left to the right of the domain again.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\psfrag{K1 =}{$\mathbf{K} = 10^{-8}\;\text{m}^2$}
\psfrag{phi1 =}{$\phi = 0.15$}
\psfrag{K2 =}{\textcolor{white}{$\mathbf{K} = 10^{-9}\;\text{m}^2$}}
\psfrag{phi2 =}{\textcolor{white}{$\phi = 0.3$}}
\psfrag{600 m}{$600 \;\text{m}$}

\end{figure}
You can use the fluids of exercise 1b).

\textbf{Hint:} The relevant position in the domain can be obtained using
\texttt{const auto \&pos=context.pos(spaceIdx, timeIdx);}

When does the front cross the material border? In paraview, the
animation view (\textit{View} $\rightarrow$ \textit{Animation View})
is a convenient way to get a rough feeling of the time-step sizes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Exercise 2}

For this exercise, first create a new problem file analogous to the
file \texttt{tutorialproblem\_coupled.hh} (e.g. with the name
\texttt{ex2\_tutorialproblem\_coupled.hh} and new spatial parameters
just like \texttt{tutorialspatialparams\_coupled.hh}. The new problem
file needs to be included in the file \texttt{tutorial\_coupled.cc}.

The new file should contain definitions of new classes with names that
relate to the file name, such as
\texttt{Ex2TutorialProblemCoupled}. Make sure that you also adjust the
guardian macros in lines \ref{tutorial-coupled:guardian1} and
\ref{tutorial-coupled:guardian1} in the header files (e.g. change
\mbox{\texttt{DUMUX\_TUTORIALPROBLEM\_COUPLED\_HH}} to
\mbox{\texttt{DUMUX\_EX2\_TUTORIALPROBLEM\_COUPLED\_HH}}). Include the
new problem file in \texttt{tutorial\_coupled.cc}.  Besides adjusting
the guardian macros, the new problem file should define and use a new
type tag for the problem as well as a new problem class
e.g. \mbox{\texttt{Ex2TutorialProblemCoupled}}. The type tag for the
problem should be adjusted, too. For this, modify line
\ref{tutorial-coupled:set-type-tag} in the problem file and the adapt
the \texttt{main} function in the file \texttt{tutorial\_coupled.cc}.

After this, change the domain parameters so that they match the domain
described by figure \ref{tutorial-coupled:ex2_Domain}. Adapt the
problem class so that the boundary conditions are consistent with
figure \ref{tutorial-coupled:ex2_BC}. Initially, the domain is fully
saturated with water and the pressure is $p_w = 5\cdot
10^5\;\text{Pa}$. Oil infiltrates from the left side. Create a grid
with $20$ cells in $x$-direction and $10$ cells in $y$-direction. The
simulation time should end at $10^6\;\text{s}$ with an initial time
step size of $100\;\text{s}$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Increase the simulation time to e.g. $4\times 10^7
  \;\text{s}$. Investigate the saturation of the wetting phas: Is the
  value range reasonable?
\item What happens if you use a grid with more cells in each direction?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exercise 3: Create a New Component}

Create a new file for the benzene component called \texttt{benzene.hh}
and implement a new component. (You may copy and modify one of the
existing components located in the directory
\texttt{dumux/material/components}. Use benzene as a new fluid and
run the model of Exercise 2 with water and benzene. Benzene has a
density of $889.51 \, \text{kg} / \text{m}^3$ and a viscosity of
$0.00112 \, \text{Pa} \; \text{s}$.
